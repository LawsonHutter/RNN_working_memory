### Structure
- (The structure of our code is a little messy due to version control and multiple people applying changes to the same file without a way to merge the multiple, checked out, files.)
* RNN_working_memory_Project is the actual current project Q1 through Q7
* RNN_working_memory_Project_Q8 contains the code for Q8 at the bottom.
* RNN_working_memory_Project_Q9 contains the code for Q9 at the bottom.
* LinearDecoderTest is a test of possible linear decoders for the assignment
* RNN_working_memory_differntModel is there for version control.  We tried a new model and this contains an intermediate model.
